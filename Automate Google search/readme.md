Google search can be automated using Python script in just 2 minutes. 
This can be done using selenium (a browser automation tool). Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. It can automatically perform the same interactions that any you need to perform manually and this is a small example of it. Mastering Selenium will help you automate your day to day tasks like controlling your tweets, 
Whatsapp texting and even just googling without actually opening a browser in just 15-30 lines of python code. 
The limits of automation is endless with selenium.
